PrsTradeLeague.4.d:0 "We have received a royal emissary from the Austrian court. The Emperor has ordered us to relinquish the island of Rhodes for the Teutonic Order to operate within the Levant region. If Otto was like any other monarch, he would be outraged by this.\n\nBut he simply couldn't give a shit about it. Besides, what could he do to stand in the way of his cousin, the Emperor? It's by his grace alone that we're even allowed to rule in this shithole of a country."
