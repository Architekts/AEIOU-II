 ## Rudolf ##

 HabsburgEvent.1.t:0 "Ride of the Valkyries"
 HabsburgEvent.1.d:0 "The plan has finally been set into motion. As agreed upon by all members of the conspiracy, we will strike at the trade leagues, destroying their economic influence by dividing and conquering their holdings.\n\nThe dockyards, trading posts, and other kinds of once-prospering enterprises by the guild systems have gone silent. Soon, mobs of soldiers either come and burn them to the ground, or local peasants ransack them for whatever goods were left behind.\n\nRudolf sits in his palace in Vienna with his face in his hands, resting on his desk.\n\nWas this the best thing to do? Was there anything we could've done differently?\n\nToo late to say now."
 HabsburgEvent.1.a:0 "Havok!"

 HabsburgEvent.2.t:0 "Rudolf's Troubled Mind"
 HabsburgEvent.2.d:0 "After Rudolf's ascension to the throne and success in ensuring the continuation of the Austrian Hegemony over the Habsburg domain, he is disappointed by the state of Europe as a whole\n\nA reformist at heart, Rudolf had dreams of bringing great change to the Empire, but his eagerness is not shared by the rest of his constituents. Europe gets slower and fatter every day, completely complacent in their debauchery, hedonism, and traditionalism.\n\nAdmitedly, Rudolf was a participant of this sin in his youth from his frequent visits with women of the night, but thanks to his wonderul wife and secretly attending theraputic sessions with an up-and-coming psychologist, Sigmund Freud, he was able to break free from those vices.\n\nBut, Europe remains enthralled. As slow as it may be, business goes on as usual and life goes on. Rudolf just fears the day that the rest of the world outpaces Europe, and finally we pay for our insolence"
 HabsburgEvent.2.a:0 "Maybe one day, there will be change..."

 HabsburgEvent.3.t:0 "Epiphany"
 HabsburgEvent.3.d:0 "The Emperor met with Sigmund Freud on a Sunday afternoon in one of the many Habsburg manors in the Alpine region. Rudolf could not be seen in public consulting with psychologists as his enemies would weaponize this to slander him. So, taking a break to breathe some mountain air, while airing some grievances would do well to clear the mind.\n\nRudolf laments to Freud about the state of the world. He feels like things as a whole have been moving at such a slow pace; with too much bureaucracy and conservative traditions serving as chains around our ankles while the rest of the world grows ever-more competent to challenge our order. He sarcastically says that he cannot even have a shipment of grain sent out without dealing with the Genoans and Venetians, nor receive a shipment of cod without arguing with the guildsmen of the Hansa. Even if an agreement is made, it takes forever to get where it needs to go because of the pitiful state of naval technology. Everyone has gotten so complacent about things that they would accept the Ottoman Janissaries marching in so long as the trains ran on time. If only Europe could awaken from this slump, who knows what all can be achieved?\n\nRudolf grew quiet for a moment, and Freud looked up from his notes. The emperor sat up, as he came to an epiphany. The world is being held back by these archaic systems, and it could be broken. The key is to break the trade leagues, the heart of the world economy that beats slower and slower as time goes on. To remove this cancer would cause a great struggle, no doubt, but it from the struggle comes a desire to prevail. To conquer this would lead to a thriving Europe, liberated by a free economy. He paid Sigmund for his time and left to convene with his closest advisors."
 HabsburgEvent.3.a:0 "We had the power all along"

 HabsburgEvent.4.t:0 "Conference in Salzburg"
 HabsburgEvent.4.d:0 "Under the guise of visiting the local bishopric, Rudolf has assembled his closest advisors and influencal men within the Austrian government completely loyal to his cause. In a tobacco smoke filled room, Rudolf describes to them the plot to break the world economy by destroying the trade leagues.\n\nThe men were stunned for a moment by the absurdity of the idea, thinking it was a joke at first, but after Rudolf's expression didn't change, they realized he was deadly serious.\n\nAfter some initial objections and the Emperor repeatively shutting them down, telling them it was inevitable, he asked them to devise ways for Austria to come out safely from this incident. An impossible task? Perhaps. But it's hard to say no to the Emperor.\n\nFor hours, they debated back and fourth about the effects of such an incident, countermeasures, and more importantly avenues of expansion (which excited both the capitalists and imperialists attending)\n\nForemost, a stockpile of resources should be collected immediately, because we won't be receiving goods anytime soon. Secondly, we should not only manipulate the German states to carry out the dirty job, but also foreign powers that stand to gain from the trade league's fall. Muscovy, the Teutons, and even the Americans were mentioned, but was discarded.\n\nOnce discussions concluded, the men tiredly left, but some also rushed to sell of any shares that were held in the trade leagues before the collapse to save their investments.\n\nThe emperor sits back in his chair in the empty room, and sighs."
 HabsburgEvent.4.a:0 "Good luck, gentlemen. We'll need it."

 HabsburgEvent.5.t:0 "Midnight in Koln"
 HabsburgEvent.5.d:0 "In the dark of a stormy night, a loud knock rings out at the cathedral at Koln. One of the monks of the"
 HabsburgEvent.5.a:0 "Auf Wiedersehen, Wilhelm."
